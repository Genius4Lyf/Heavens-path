                <h5 class="description" style="font-weight: normal;  color: white;">
                    The teen years are an especially vulnerable time for young people. The formation of identity begins as we bridge the gap between childhood and adulthood. Adolescents with psychological and behavioral health issues may think, feel and act in ways that are confusing, frightening, and unmanageable for both their parents and themselves. A breakdown in family communication and functioning can lead to a sense of despair and hopelessness. There is hope. Our Heavenly Guided Paths for Teens provide proven, evidence-based care that addresses these complexities, reuniting families in the process.

                  We provide adolescents with a safe haven for recovery, growth and healing. Teen mental health issues can be caused by a variety of factors: trauma, biological predisposition, environmental factors at home or in school and so forth. We deeply understand the need for a thorough clinical evaluation and personalized treatment planning to ensure a successful long-term impact. Our clinically trained staff treats the whole person using customized, tailored strategies for teens struggling with depression, anxiety, bipolar and other mood disorders. We also treat subsequent secondary destructive behaviors like self-harm, substance abuse, and eating disorders.
              </h5>
              <h5 class="description-1" style="font-weight: normal;">
                  As a parent, it can be hard to know where to turn for help. Our mission is to provide the best possible treatment for your son or daughter. Because our focus is exceptional care, we keep our census small. This allows our team of clinical experts to provide the time and attention necessary to create an individual treatment plan specific to each patient’s needs. Each teen works with licensed therapists with a variety of backgrounds, providing a tailored, evidence-based approach to recovery.
